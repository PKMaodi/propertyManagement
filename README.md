# propertyManagement
A basic JavaEE property manager app. 

Thato is an entrepreneur involved in the property business. She builds houses and thereafter rent them out to the 
general public in need of accommodation. Most of her houses are located in the townships where the property 
market is booming. In as much as her business is lucrative, the monthly income is unpredictable because of the 
frequently changing financial circumstances of people. In some months the demand is high, and in others it is low.

Thato needs a web application that will help her monitor the monthly income generated by the properties. Using
the provided table above, Thato needs an application that will her to perform the following tasks: 
• Given an area code, determine and display the month which she has made the least income. The actual 
amount must also be returned and displayed.
• Given a month, determine and display the area that has given her the highest income for that particular 
month. The actual amount must also be returned and displayed
